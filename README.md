Group project for COMP 324: Web Application

This is a group project I worked on with two classmates.
We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, NodeJS, and the Yelp Fusion API as a part of this project.
My role in the project was primarily working with the JavaScript, jQuery, and NodeJS code. 
I developed the code that created simple servers that pulled in the data from the API.
